# WhiteboardErasingRobot
The purpose of this robot was to help reduce the time and energy spent by professors erasing whiteboards during lectures. Intead of pausing during a lecture to erase a whiteboard, the robot could erase a whiteboard that is not currently being used by the professor and have it ready for use by the time the professor needs more space to write. 

This code was used to program a LEGO EV3 robot to erase all whiteboard markings of a desired color (or markings of all colors) on a rectangular whiteboard of any size. The project uses a Lego Mindstorms EV3 Brick to control four EV3 motors, two EV3 color sensors, an EV3 Gyro sensor and a touch sensor used to create a bumper. 

## Features of the robot:
- follows a specific path designed to be able to reach all areas of a whiteboard (inspired by the path an ice resurfacer follows around an ice rink)
- can calibrate it path according to the size of any rectangluar whiteboard it is being used on
- can detect if it has travelled away from its desired path or has encoutered an obstacle
